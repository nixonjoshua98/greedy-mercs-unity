    __Model Classes__
        - Models are primarily used as data transfer objects between either the server or file system        
        - Model classes can contain other attributes which are set at runtime (ex. values from scriptable objects) but once a model 'requires' a method to be implemented,
            then a new class should be created and all logic should move away from the model class (ex. model classes should contain attributes only)
